Exercise 1: Prime Numbers
Write a Python program that checks whether a given number is prime or not. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
Exercise 2: Product of Random Numbers

Exercise 4:
✅ Problem Statement (Question): Hospital Billing System
A hospital charges its patients based on the following:
•	Room charges per day: ₹2,000
•	Doctor consultation fee (flat): ₹1,500
•	Lab test charges: Based on the number of tests taken. Each test costs ₹300
•	Medicine charges: Total cost of medicines provided
•	Discount: If the total bill (before discount) exceeds ₹10,000, a 10% discount is applied
Write a Python program to calculate the final bill for a patient who:
•	Stayed for 4 days
•	Had 3 lab tests
•	Had medicine charges of ₹2,400.
