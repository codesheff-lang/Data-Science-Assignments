Assignment Tasks:
1. State the Hypotheses statement:
2. Calculate the Test Statistic:
Use the following formula to calculate the test statistic(z):
where:
●	ˉxˉ = sample mean weekly cost (Rs. 3,050)
●	μ = theoretical mean weekly cost according to the cost model (W = $1,000 + $5X for X = 600 units)
●	σ = 5*25 units
●	n = sample size (25 restaurants)
3. Determine the Probability and compare:
Using the alpha level of 5% (α = 0.05),
4. Make a Decision:
Compare the test statistic with the critical value to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.
5. Conclusion:
Based on the decision in step 4, conclude whether there is strong evidence to support the restaurant owners' claim that the weekly operating costs are higher than the model suggests.

Submission Guidelines:
●	Prepare a python file detailing each step of your hypothesis testing process.
●	Include calculations for the test statistic and the critical value.
●	Provide a clear conclusion based on your analysis.
