pos,good story very skeptical about writer like book just because fun read very skeptical about way writer admits he seen ufo sightings night after night chapter 10 book my question why world guy like john keel arms himself only flashlight camera he obviously sets himself up see strange lights does bring camera capture event unless he makes book pictures examine hording all evidence himeself will put him good story teller catagory ufooligist must admit am tired all hidden evidence about matter think all ready truth want my opinion just threw all his credibility bin must admit really enjoyed book
neg,disappointing mothman story indeed fascinating one unfortunately same adjective cannot applied mothman prophecies john keels theories regarding nature origin ufos general mothman particular more bizarre than phenomena themselves also put off mr keels tedious obsession men black behaving badlyive given singularly overrated book two stars rather than only one because does supply some albeit nowhere near enough information extraordinary occurrences more than 30 years ago
neg,repetitive lackluster wanted read before seeing film wow what bore keels book reads like some scattershot diary himself narrator maybe stuff revelatory back when originally published now xfiles cultural phenomena all other media about ufos paranormal floating around seems pedestrian comparison descriptions always same only names change each chaptersightingcontactingalso do read book before seeing movie will sap some enjoyment mark pellingtons excellent film fact amazed how well screenwriter richard hatem took dross put narrative structure around thats another review belongs elsewhere
neg,mothmanputting loose ends together found movie leading many directionswhy johns wife appearing point pleasent mothman why did john appear gordon 3 nights 230 am these questions never answered movie did miss something movie ran long me maybe because loose ends could wrong decide go see movie
neg,very detailed never ending usually like books better than movie interesting book although touches everything seems repeat itself time after time movie focused more actual mothman felt book just mentioned among many other things book should been named mothman men black ufos kitchen sink glad done book dont waste money book check out library
pos,paranormal epic book rarity ufo literature primarily bc most ufo books present information dates names places events sense completely without any feeling substance beyond happening shocker ending mothman prophecies already know read 1st chapter youve been drawn further further into lives main participants ending hits like sledgehammer bc youve spent last 250 pages forgetting all about more ufo books should written humanistic approach perhaps subject wouldnt taboo
pos,must fortean buffs believe well frankly dont believe all though im sure those folks west virginia saw something mighty interesting all lengthy annals fortean supernormal paranoialit journalism keel does stand out author aboveaverage storytelling ability he also ability take himself entirely seriously trait often sorely lacking genre all transphenomenon grand unified theory weird stuff offer book definitely worth checking out those interested field
pos,get book while its still print investigators like john keel dont seem exist anymore get book while its still print honest approach toward unexplained phenemenon will probably never able compete books assure being visited ets angelsdemons andor ancient deities people want something believe belief enemywarns keel how many paranormal researchers do know would say goldfish fishbowl being watched over toyed what question keel will leave will keep staring wide eyed up ceiling late night bed
neg,movie better usually book always better case no way found just bunch disjointed ramblings partial recounts what happened couldnt even finish gave away movie didnt follow book all least there thread storyline follow
neg,wheres beef mothman case there lot about 60s obvious reasons forgotten do remember there lot instamatic cameras 8 mm movie cameras around guess my question why there no pictures thing believe good people point pleasant saw something there least 100 reported sightings mothman simply cannot accept authors statement all those cameras newspeople took along failed work one reason otherthe movie excellent based entirely wacky book which written kind random fashion all good first place show me pictures
neg,pretty disappointed saw movie intrigued enough read book which thought would maybe give better idea what really happened west virginia year disappointed find mr keel spent lot time dwelling ufo encounters history ufo encounters spent little time talking about events west virginia other than how blended history ufology movie more interesting dont know how developed movie based off book didnt buy book read about air force involvement maybe lack thereof ufo sightings about how mr keel been hunting ufos ufo witnesses big letdown
neg,little value understandable why his other books according his own admission well receivedmr keel offers some rather off wall explanations little nothing way proof except his word those unfamiliar subject controversial book may some interest even very little valuemr keel dismisses wave his hand everything written valid serious investigations admittedly there those who written who do deserve taken seriously mr keel top listdesmond
neg,waste time dont get me wrong believe ufos certainly mothman since my friends aunt saw 90 nonfiction book nonsense keels semiacurate listing real life mystery mothman wins single star speculation he pushes gospel truth laughable mostly based questionable facts ideas theoretical best want know about mothman read james cohens book mysterious beasts want waste time amazons time buy mothman prophecies
neg,what looking great story will really drag into dont read book lord help me thought would go crazy only got through first three chapters there ounce structure its just bunch thoughts reports sightings ufos mothmen other oddities im sure keel intended retelling things he believed really happened he honestly thought he writing novel cant take anymore give up usually ill read just about anything all way through give fair chance all these little scraps sitings no order whatsoever make me say what
neg,thoroughly debunked book typical keelchockfull anecdotes skewed information speculation hoaxes many keels weird experiences case jokes perpetrated gray barkerall presented factual reportingmothman does exist several writersmost notably joe nickellhave thoroughly debunked incident true facts never stopped keelim fan keels writings take grain salt one his best efforts rankles me he positions himself serious journalist
neg,mothman fiction author claims book factual my gut feeling its fictional fiction well written just bunch short tales kind mixed together
neg,okay ill admit didnt clue what going book which claims real obviously work fiction nor did really much reason toufosmen blackmothmenabducteesgovernment coverupssightingsits all here regardless makes no sense whatsoeveri actually walked into thinking going great there would wonderful story based upon legend mothman no bombarded 266 pages research having no really meaning thesis honestly say avoid like plague
neg,initially interesting eventually saw through him recommended me someone whom think beleives interdimensional nonet aspect all kept open mind finally came conclusion john keel wrote fradualent contrived story underlying distracted attitude reality quite insulting reader book probably pure fiction seek more than fiction bordering pure trash investigator he poorly documents his findings dont buy check out library please
neg,reads like keels dropped his notes never rearranged excellent suspenseful information all over place far material travel back forth west virgina london ohio back again would enjoyed first part book supporting information phenomena itself how indeed appeared elsewhere history how phenomena ties ufo sightings etc keels hypothesis all paranormal activity comes parallel universe difficult believe even paranormal studies im sure firstalthough book suspenseful written well just organized poorly revise john can do
pos,good read good read half what written book true world much stranger than can imagineone my favorite books
neg,boring unbelievable story normally prefer books movies mothman prophecies only boring unbelievable nonfiction story product authors imagination perhaps 1975 when novel first copywritten spectacular those who thinking purchasing book especially after viewing movie id say pass up purchase vhs dvd
neg,unidentified reading object approached book fairly open mind expecting read interesting story about strange events 1967 unfortunately mr keels tendency ramble strange albeit somewhat fascinating mixture conspiracy theories ufo sightings men black stories made book incoherent mess book begins ends events point pleasant spends middle attempting connect those events literally hundreds other experiences throughout world throughout history
pos,interesting very fascinating read does focus only mothamn sightings all other strange events supposed happened looking book will prove mothman exists dont think proper book mainly about what went first sighting mothman felling bridge there lot strange happenings during time read im presenting information what heppened saw involved make up mind whether its true
neg,what youd expect although movie very well done those who enjoyed spooky suspenseful story book however movie seems hollywood took very few pieces book turned great movie which kind other way around usual book being better than movie book good ufo buff only mentions mothman other than very boring read expected reading about same scenario what saw movie extremely disappointed

neg,letdown john keels mothman prophecies could great book actually concentrated mothman sightings around point pleasant west virginia midtolate 1960s unfortunately book isnt really about mothman should instead entitled john keel explains how universe really works every mothman story keel relates book he offers least three other stories his personal life his adventures researching paranormal his decidedly offbeat theories about paranormal events what causes book isnt really about mothman sightings west virginia much goofy memoir john keels research into world ufos demons ghosts other bizarre events someone who bought book read about mothman about keels disjointed ramblings ravings sorely disappointed recommended
neg,mothman bits pieces book like movie fact prefer movie book composed bits pieces john keels others phenomenal experiences difficult read only because bad press printing also because very clipped disjointed bought book delve further after seeing movie ended up more confused go movieforget book
pos,dark stormy night john keels mothman prophecies follows usual form ufology books he presents large collection anecdotes personal observations experiences mixes some debunking woo scientific mind throws some ancient gods goddesses references fairies variety religious sightings par course genre puts reviewer mind charlie browns standard beginning tales dark stormy nightdespite its rather disorganized somewhat repetitive presentation again fairly standard genre keel relates his narrative earnestly he will engage interest men black saucer shaped vehicles diamondshaped windows thyroidlike eyes gets attention youll enjoy mothman propheciesthe recent movie based only loosely keels research way will fail satisfy informed ufology readers

pos,great music lot great price disc contains ornette colemans pioneering 37minute free jazz plus 40 minutes shorter pieces recorded same year little less money than american release free jazz get about twice much music title track final piece fitting climax great set music said jazz disc may more challenging than some listeners would like among extended collective improvisations sixties besides being first one more immediately accessible because swings cooks can tell musicians actively listening each other responding each others work just showing off venting emotions nutshell free jazz less cosmic than sun ras magic city less cerebral than cecil taylor less primal than coltranes ascension probably more likely hook into intensely brilliant musical world

neg,ok book sure book gives some harsh warnings about desensitization culture withering away intellectual importance its radical premise detracts storys legitimacy worth bradbury anticipates complete elimination all books literature do agree moving more automated fastpaced society less emphasis love personal relationships will never reach such extreme level its simply rediculous concept contest cannot worry about whether others getting daily dose shakespeare joyce bible choose read own will always chance do imagine reading review dont run high risk losing interest books lifetime yes bradbury does offer striking prophesy direction societal development use book basis outrcy against cultures future ludicrous

neg,fahrenheit 451 review fahrenheit 451 unusual book about alternate future book firemen start fires instead putting out dont just randomly burn down peoples houses burn down ones which people books may thinking why would care about books well alternate future books illegal bet seems very ironic yes book about there being no books didnt like book felt his writing style very unusual author ray bradbury didnt difficult sentences he did seem jump around he would never very clear within each every page he would jump around lose readers attention rambling unorthodox style there prime age group book would junior high schoolers high schoolers probably because about difficulty alternate future may most appealing age
neg,there better dystopias out there book hard read start eventually one can infer what going very little explained plainly copy read library there mispelled sticky notes throughout what looked like two middle schoolers trying figure out what going instance why beatty ask about dog dose he know where books arethe ending alright really liked quote about how inability build creates need destroy
neg,bit iffy side read fahrenheit 451 class eighth grade beginning knew book would turn out quite eloquent philsosphical also extremely tedious almost fell asleep some occasions bradbury does good job describing sections story sometimes gets carried away forgets about some mood example when city bombed there should some line chaos people inhabiting city running lives conclusion struggled through book only read out coercion would never read again
neg,overrated ive just finished reading book although premise behind intriguing books feels unfinished rushedalso bradburys elegant descriptive style writing feels like shroud covers rather poor character development lack interesting characters book also needs large section should basically precede book stands now dedicated towards describing overall setting government climate order set proper moodtherefore cannot recommend title
neg,fahrenheit 451 worth book boring unless interested science fiction ray bradburys work probably wont like book takes place future world where all books banned people spend lot time watching television montag main character firefighter who burns books story book ok gets boring there no excitement book easy read there isnt any very hard vocabulary dont read book fourth grade younger because might hard read just stick movie interested topic
