Improving Customer Satisfaction through Automated Review Sentiment Analysis
Overview
You are a product manager at an e-commerce company like Amazon. Your company receives thousands of customer reviews daily for various products. While ratings are available, they don’t always capture customer sentiment accurately — especially when the text and rating conflict.
Business Problem:
Your goal is to build an automated Sentiment Analysis System to classify incoming product reviews as Positive or Negative. This will help:
•	Monitor product performance in real-time
•	Identify products with sudden spikes in negative feedback
•	Improve customer satisfaction by addressing complaints faster

Dataset
•	Each row is one Amazon customer review for some product.
•	The dataset has been pre-labeled — so you already know if the review is positive or negative.
•	This is a typical sentiment analysis dataset, often used for training or testing natural language processing (NLP) models.
📊 Rows:
10,000 customer reviews
📑 Columns:
1.	label
o	Type: Text (Categorical)
o	Values: pos (positive) or neg (negative)
o	What it means: The sentiment of the review — whether the customer’s feedback is positive or negative.
2.	review
o	Type: Text
o	Values: Actual text of the review written by the customer.
o	What it means: What the customer said about the product in their own words — for example: “Excellent Soundtrack! I love it!”

Tasks
Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates, handle missing reviews if any, preprocess text (lowercasing, stopwords removal).
Exploratory Analysis: Word clouds, sentiment distribution, most common positive/negative words.
Model Development: Use NLP techniques (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT embeddings) with models like Logistic Regression, SVM, or Neural Networks.
Validation: Use train/test split, cross-validation, and metrics like accuracy, F1-score.


Submission Guidelines
•	Your submission should include a comprehensive report and the complete codebase.
•	Your code should be well-documented and include comments explaining the major steps.
Evaluation Criteria
•	Correct implementation of data preprocessing and feature extraction.
•	Accuracy and robustness of the classification model.
•	Depth and insightfulness of the sentiment analysis.
•	Clarity and thoroughness of the evaluation and discussion sections.
•	Overall quality and organization of the report and code.
Good luck, and we look forward to your insightful analysis of the given dataset!
